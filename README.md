# 3D-Scanning-Motion-Capture

## Exercise 01 - Back-Projection
In this exercise we generate 3D meshes from depth and color maps which can be captured by camera
like a Microsoft Kinect.

## Exercise 02 - Implicit Surfaces - Marching Cubes
In this exercise we generate 3D meshes from implicit surfaces.

## Exercise 3 – Coarse Alignment – Procrustes
In this exercise we want to align 3D shapes. We will explore the Procrustes algorithms and test it on a set of
two shapes with sparse correspondences provided.

## Exercise 4 – Gaussian – Surface – Registration
In this exercise, we explore different optimization problems, that can be solved with a (non-)linear solver,
Ceres (http://ceres-solver.org/) in our case.
