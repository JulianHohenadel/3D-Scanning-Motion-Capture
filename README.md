# 3D-Scanning-Motion-Capture

## Exercise 01 - Back-Projection
In this exercise we generate 3D meshes from depth and color maps which can be captured by camera
like a Microsoft Kinect.

## Exercise 02 - Implicit Surfaces - Marching Cubes
In this exercise we generate 3D meshes from implicit surfaces.
